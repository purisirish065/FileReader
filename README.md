# FileReader
Read a CSV file and do some search operations
-to run the code: 
-clone the files
-open the project as spring boot application for any IDE and run as spring boot application.
- command line, compile the code as spring boot
-run the project
-user can choose either to see the data or perform search operations.


- for testing purpose we could create different sets of data, which would push the search operations to its limit. I think the most problem would come in the first search operation where a customer can search for a bank using 5 different criterias, I dont think my approach is a good one, I think there is a better way to do the search operation.
